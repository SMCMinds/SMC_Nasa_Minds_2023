To troubleshoot the BrickPi3
----------------------------

If the BrickPi3 is not performing as expected, here are some things to try:

* Check how fast the yellow LED is flashing. If it's flashing 1 time per
  second, the battery voltage is good (at least 7.2v). If it's flashing twice
  per second, the battery voltage is adequate, but not great (less than 7.2v).
  If it's flashing 4 times per second, the battery voltage is too low, and the
  motors are automatically disabled.

* Ensure adequate voltage for running the BrickPi3 and Raspberry Pi. If the
  battery voltage is below 6.8v, the motors might be automatically disabled in
  attempt to keep the Raspberry Pi from crashing due to dead batteries. If the
  battery voltage is below about 6.5v, the Raspberry Pi might not be getting
  adequate power. Instead of running on batteries, you can connect 5v directly
  to the Raspberry Pi using the micro-USB power input connector to ensure that
  the Raspberry Pi will be powered adequately in case your batteries are dead.

* Run the troubleshooting script `all_tests.sh`. Look through the output to
  see if there's anything unexpected. If you don't find the problem, you can
  upload the `log.txt` file from the desktop (`/home/pi/Desktop/log.txt`) to
  the [forums] and ask for help (please give a clear description of the problem
  you're experiencing). You can run the troubleshooting script by running this:

        sudo bash /home/pi/Dexter/BrickPi3/Troubleshooting/all_tests.sh
