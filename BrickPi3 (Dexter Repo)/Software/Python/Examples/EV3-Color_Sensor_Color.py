# This code is an example for reading an EV3 color sensor connected to PORT_1 of the BrickPi3
# 
# Hardware: Connect an EV3 or NXT touch sensor to BrickPi3 Port 1.
# 
# Results:  When you run this program, you should see a 0 when the touch sensor is not pressed, and a 1 when the touch sensor is pressed.
